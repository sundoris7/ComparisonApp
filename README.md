# My Personal Project

## A comparison tool for rental properties

Users will be able to:
- collect rental properties that they are interested in
- compare collected rental properties by characteristics
- compare collected rental properties with their own preferences

The purpose of this application is to help users **compare options** of something that they want to purchase. 
In the context of the current project, this application is designed for the comparison of *rental properties*. 
Users will be able to **create a collection** of rental properties that they want to compare by entering each property's 
price, location, size, and other characteristics. Users can then compare all the properties, as 
well as filter and sort the properties by specific characteristics. Once a graphical user interface is 
implemented, the collection can be maintained in an intuitive table structure.

Anyone looking to find a new place to rent can use this application to easily compare all prospective properties in
one place. Rental properties are posted on multiple platforms, making it difficult for the renter to keep track of each
place and its qualities. Real estate agents can also use this tool to present listings to prospective renters and 
buyers. Moreover, as previously mentioned, this application can be used to *compare any item* that a user might want to 
purchase. For example, this tool can be used to compare cars, flights, schools, computers, smartphones, and so on, by
individual users (buyers), dealerships, travel agents, online retailers, and more.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:
- Add a new property to my collection of prospective rental properties
- View a list of the properties in my collection
- Select a property and view its characteristics in detail
- Select a property and edit a characteristic
- Compare all collected properties together
- Compare all collected properties by a specific characteristic (sort and filter)
- Save my list of properties to a file, at any point in time
- Reload a specific list of properties in its last-saved state

## Refactoring to improve design: 
- Reduce repetitive code, especially in the sorting and filtering methods
- Implement a graphical user interface for the current console application, with full functionality of the user stories
